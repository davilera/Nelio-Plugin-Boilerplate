# Nelio Plugin Boilerplate

This project is based on the [WordPress Plugin
Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project.

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `README.md`. The file that you're currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` subdirectory that contains the source code - a fully
executable WordPress plugin.
* A `mkplugin` shell script that will help you create your first plugin based
on Nelio's Plugin Boilerplate.

## Installation

You can start a new plugin by simply downloading the project (or cloning it)
and running the `mkplugin` script. Simply follow the steps and you'll have a
new plugin folder ready.
